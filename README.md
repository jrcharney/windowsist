Software Repo and Wiki for Linux Users who Need to Use Windows

Windowsist is a Software Repo and Wiki for Linux Users who can't bear to part with their Torvaldsian Utopia but have to face the fact that in a Windows (and Mac) world, they have to suck it up.

While most people will still use Cygwin, Msys, or remote into a shell using PuTTY to compensate, this repository is designed to take advantage of the new features that Windows has added for using Ubuntu on Windows.

Along the way, I will also include somethings I highly recommend you install, a `.vimrc` file to get you up and running, and where to find all those fonts and toys that make everything work.

Oh, sure there are still some good things to come out of Microsoft.  Generally, I consider Word and Excel the best thing they every made (up until they changed the interface in 2007 where you had to relearn where everything was).  But at some point you will still need to use a Windows Machine for something espeically since Google has yet to fix that bug where when you export a Google Docs file to a Word Document and the line spacing is all screwed up.

The Windowist repo serves as the home for all things that still need to be bridged between Linux and Windows.

I didn't stop using Windows because of a hate of Microsoft. (OK, maybe it was 40% hate, but the other 60% was when I used open source software Windows would bloat it up like Kristy Alley in fat suit.)  However, things have changed for the better!

But I have learned some things over the years on how to use computers better.  And with my ability to explain technology in a way that doesn't try to insult the people who I help, here's yet another place where my generosity and knowledge has a place to shine.
